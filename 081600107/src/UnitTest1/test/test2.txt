Humans glance at an image and instantly know what objects are in the image, where they are, and how they interact. The human visual system is fast and accurate, allowing us to perform complex tasks like driving with little conscious thought. Fast, accurate algorithms for object detection would allow computers to drive cars without specialized sensors, enable assistive devices to convey real-time
scene information to human users, and unlock the potential
for general purpose, responsive robotic systems.
Current detection systems repurpose classifiers to perform detection. To detect an object, these systems take a
classifier for that object and evaluate it at various locations
and scales in a test image. Systems like deformable parts
models (DPM) use a sliding window approach where the
classifier is run at evenly spaced locations over the entire
image
